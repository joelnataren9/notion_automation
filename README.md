# Notion Automation

## Introduction
 Hello, welcome to my git repository. This is a small and quick flask application I created to be able to serve and do an API to add expenses to my own Notion Database. If you have a notion account and you want to enroll, here are the steps you need to follow to be able to do it.

 This app aims to help with better tracking your finances by enabling an endpoint you can use with the iphone shortcuts to quickly add a payment without having to pay a monthly fee for tracking your expenses.

 ## Onboarding
 I will finish this later...
